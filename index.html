      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Factor investing has grown with advances in machine learning and the availability of rich market data.
        Human decisions are prone to bias, while algorithmic analysis can uncover relationships that are not easily visible and improve portfolio construction.
        This project applies three machine learning models: OLS, Random Forest, and Neural Networks with varying layers, to predict next-month Information Coefficients (IC), including both Rank IC (RIC) and Normal IC (NIC), using factor signals such as Size, Book-to-Market, and Momentum.
        The predicted ICs are used to form long–short portfolios across multiple quantile partitions.
        Across quantiles, portfolios constructed from Random Forest predicted NIC consistently outperform the market, achieving higher win rates and stronger cumulative returns, especially at finer partitions (450 to 900 buckets).
        Overall, Random Forest with the three factors is the most reliable method for improving portfolio performance and stability among the tested models.

  <h2>Methodology & Workflow</h2>
  <p>
    The workflow of this project follows a structured pipeline that links data extraction, 
    machine learning prediction, and portfolio construction. Monthly TEJ data are first 
    cleaned and transformed to compute the Size, Book-to-Market, and Momentum factors. 
    Using these factor signals, three machine learning models—OLS, Random Forests, and 
    Neural Networks—are trained to generate one-month-ahead predictions of Information 
    Coefficients (ICs), including both Rank IC (RIC) and Normal IC (NIC).
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the predicted IC sign, stocks are sorted by their factor values and allocated 
    into multiple quantile partitions (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 450, and 900 buckets). 
    When the predicted IC is positive, the strategy takes long positions in the highest 
    quantile and short positions in the lowest quantile. When the IC is negative, the 
    long–short positions are reversed. This framework allows us to evaluate how different 
    machine learning models enhance predictive accuracy and improve portfolio performance 
    across increasingly fine quantile structures.

    <h2>Rank IC and Normal IC</h2>
    <p>
      Information Coefficients (ICs) measure how well a factor predicts future returns. 
      In this project, we use two types of ICs: Rank IC (RIC) and Normal IC (NIC).
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Rank IC (RIC)</h3>
    <p>
      Rank IC first converts raw factor values into cross-sectional ranks within each month, 
      and then computes the correlation between these ranks and the realized returns in the 
      next month. Let \(X_t = (X_{1t}, \ldots, X_{Nt})\) be the factor values at month \(t\), 
      and \(R_{t+1} = (R_{1,t+1}, \ldots, R_{N,t+1})\) be the one-month-ahead returns. 
      The Rank IC at month \(t\) is
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      \[
        \mathrm{RIC}_t = \mathrm{Corr}\big( \operatorname{rank}(X_t),\, R_{t+1} \big).
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it uses ranks instead of raw values, Rank IC is less sensitive to outliers 
      and monotonic transformations of the factor, making it a robust measure of the 
      cross-sectional ordering power of the factor.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Normal IC (NIC)</h3>
    <p>
      Normal IC directly computes the Pearson correlation between the raw factor values 
      and the next-month returns. Using the same notation, the Normal IC at month \(t\) is
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      \[
        \mathrm{NIC}_t = \mathrm{Corr}\big( X_t,\, R_{t+1} \big).
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      Normal IC is more sensitive to the magnitude of factor values and extreme observations, 
      but it captures linear relationships between the factor and future returns. 
      In this study, both RIC and NIC are predicted by machine learning models and 
      then used to guide long–short portfolio construction.
